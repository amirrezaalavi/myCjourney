### This is my C programming language learning journey!
I've been thinking for so long about learning a low level language. Two years ago I started learning the C language alongside the Oâ€™Reilly Practical C Programming book. This repo is dedicated to solving the problems and rewriting some of the examples.
#### The structure
Every example I rewrote starts with the lesson number followed by the example number, for e.g. 14-5.c is the 5th example of the 14th chapter. Sometimes the examples are changed because I wanted to try new things and learn more about C.
